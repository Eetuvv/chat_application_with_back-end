# Chat application with back-end support
Client with GUI for <a href="https://github.com/Eetuvv/chat_server">chat-server</a>  
Not fully working yet. Currently registration and posting messages work pretty well, but there is no support for editing user details yet.  There are also some bugs and code needs some cleaning up.
#### To run this:
<ol>
<li>
Clone <a href="https://github.com/Eetuvv/chat_server">this repository</a> for back-end. 
</li>
<li> Follow the instructions in the repository on how to run the server.</li>
<li> Clone this repository and build it.</li>
<li> Set launch parameter to certificate file path, eg. "C:\Users\User\Documents\Chat_application_with_back_end\localhost.cer"
<li> Run both chat-server and chat application.</li>
</ol>
